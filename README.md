# Quantifying composite summary of RNA velocity between cell clusters in single-cell RNAseq data

This repository contains the code used to quantify and summarise individual RNA streams (computed using, e.g. [velocyto](http://velocyto.org/)) into a composite score that quantifies transition between two clusters. This is used in the following piece of work to evaluate the transition between different B cell subsets in a single-cell RNAseq dataset of peripheral B cells ('Pure' dataset).

The R markdown file contains all necessary functions to calculate and plot these estimates. Necessary input files for the 'Pure' dataset can be downloaded from ArrayExpress from [here]().

The associated publication is now in bioRxiv [here](). If you use it please cite:
